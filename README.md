# MUHC - Duke Statin Benefit Calculator

> Current guidelines recommend statins in the primary prevention of
> cardiovascular disease on the basis of predicted cardiovascular risk without
> directly considering the expected benefits of statin therapy based on the
> available randomized, controlled trial evidence.
> [...]
> An individualized statin benefit approach can identify lower-risk individuals
> who have equal or greater expected benefit from statins in primary prevention
> compared with higher-risk individuals. This approach may help develop
> guideline recommendations that better identify individuals who meaningfully
> benefit from statin therapy. [\[1\]][1]

This repository provides the source code for a simple calculator intended for
use by physicians and patients to determine the expected benefit of statins as
calculated in [the paper][1].
