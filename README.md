# MUHC - Duke Statin Benefit Calculator

> Current guidelines recommend statins in the primary prevention of

> An individualized statin benefit approach can identify lower-risk individuals

This repository provides the source code for a simple calculator intended for
use by physicians and patients to determine the expected benefit of statins as
calculated in [the paper][1].
